        <p>
          I am a highly motivated and creative web
          developer with a work history in management
          specializing in problem solving, team work, time management,
          adaptability, and great client communication. 
          In my free time I like to play tennis, hike Phoenix mountains, go out on the boat, and anything outdoors that doesnâ€™t kill me!
